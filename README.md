# Automated Rating Curve (ARC) Generator
ARC is an Python-based code that encompasses much of the functionality of the hydraulic modeling software AutoRoute. ARC inputs a series of raster datasets and outputs rating curves that describe the relationship between streamflow and water surface elevation.

The resulting rating curves can be paired with a flood inundation mapping software to produce flood inundation maps. 

## Getting started
Below are step-by-step instructions for setting up the ARC.

1. Clone this repository.
   - In the upper right hand corner of this screen, left-click the green <> Code button and copy the text.
2. Download [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/miniconda-install/).
3. Open the "Anaconda Prompt" and create you Conda environment.
   - To activate the "ARC" environment open an Anaconda Command Prompt and type "conda env create -f environment_ARC.yml"
4. Your ARC environment should be ready to roll!
